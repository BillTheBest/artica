<innodb_additional_mem_pool_size_text>Stores the internal data structure.[br]
 Make sure it is big enough to store data about all your InnoDB tables (you will see warnings in the error log if the server is using OS memory instead).</innodb_additional_mem_pool_size_text>

<innodb_buffer_pool_size_text>
While the key buffer size is the variable to target for MyISAM tables, for InnoDB tables, it is innodb buffer pool size.[br]
Again, you want this as high as possible to minimize slow disk usage.[br]
On a dedicated MySQL server running InnoDB tables, you can set this up to 80% of the total available memory.</innodb_buffer_pool_size_text>
<join_buffer_size>JOIN: Taille fu buffeur</join_buffer_size>
<join_buffer_size_text>
The size of the buffer that is used for plain index scans, range index scans, and joins that do not use indexes and thus perform full table scans.[br]
 Normally, the best way to get fast joins is to add indexes.[br]
Increase the value of join_buffer_size to get a faster full join when adding indexes is not possible.[br]
One join buffer is allocated for each full join between two tables.[br]
For a complex join between several tables for which indexes are not used, multiple join buffers might be necessary.</join_buffer_size_text>
<key_buffer>KEY: Buffeur</key_buffer>
<key_buffer_size>KEY: Taille du buffeur</key_buffer_size>
<key_buffer_size_text>Index blocks for MyISAM tables are buffered and are shared by all threads.[br]
key_buffer_size is the size of the buffer used for index blocks.[br]
The key buffer is also known as the key cache[br]
You can increase the value to get better index handling for all reads and multiple writes;[br]
on a system whose primary function is to run MySQL using the MyISAM storage engine, 25% of the machine's total memory is an acceptable value for this variable.[br]
 However, you should be aware that, if you make the value too large (for example, more than 50% of the machine's total memory), 
 your system might start to page and become extremely slow</key_buffer_size_text>
<key_buffer_text>Set key_buffer to 5 - 50% of your RAM depending on how much you use MyISAM tables, but keep key_buffer_size + InnoDB buffer pool size under 80% of your RAM

<query_cache_limit_text>Don't cache results that are larger than this number of bytes. The default value is 1MB</query_cache_limit_text>
<query_cache_size>Taille du cache pour QUERY</query_cache_size>
<query_cache_size_text>The amount of memory allocated for caching query results.[br]
 The default value is 0, which disables the query cache.[br]
 The allowable values are multiples of 1024; other values are rounded down to the nearest multiple</query_cache_size_text>
<read_buffer_size>READ buffer size</read_buffer_size>
<read_buffer_size_text>Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a buffer of this size (in bytes) for each table it scans.[br]
If you do many sequential scans, you might want to increase this value, which defaults to 131072. The value of this variable should be a multiple of 4KB.[br]
If it is set to a value that is not a multiple of 4KB, its value will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 4KB.</read_buffer_size_text>

<skip-external-locking>External locking</skip-external-locking>
<skip-external-locking_text>
External locking is the use of file system locking to manage contention for database tables by multiple processes.[br]
External locking is used in situations where a single process such as the MySQL server cannot be assumed to be the only process that requires access to tables

<sort_buffer>SORT: buffeur</sort_buffer>
<sort_buffer_size>SORT buffer size</sort_buffer_size>
<sort_buffer_size_text>Each thread that needs to do a sort allocates a buffer of this size. Increase this value for faster ORDER BY or GROUP BY operations</sort_buffer_size_text>
<sort_buffer_text>
The sort_buffer is very useful for speeding up myisamchk operations (which is why it is set much higher for that purpose in the default configuration files), 
but it can also be useful everyday when performing large numbers of sorts.[br]
Successfully upped it to 9MB on a 3GB server running quite a few sorts.

<table_cache>TABLE: Cache</table_cache>
<table_cache>TABLE: Cache</table_cache>
<table_open_cache>TABLE: Cache d'ouverture</table_open_cache>
<table_open_cache_text>The number of open tables for all threads.[br] Increasing this value increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires</table_open_cache_text>
<thread_cache_size>Taille du cache des Threads</thread_cache_size>
<thread_cache_size_text>How many threads the server should cache for reuse.[br]
 When a client disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there are fewer than thread_cache_size threads there.[br]
Requests for threads are satisfied by reusing threads taken from the cache if possible, and only when the cache is empty is a new thread created.[br]
This variable can be increased to improve performance if you have a lot of new connections.[br]
(Normally, this doesn't provide a notable performance improvement if you have a good thread implementation.)
</thread_cache_size_text>
<tmp_table_size>TABLES: taille des tables temporaires</tmp_table_size>
<tmp_table_size_text>
This variable determines the maximum size for a temporary table in memory.[br]
If the table becomes too large, a MYISAM table is created on disk.[br]
Try to avoid temporary tables by optimizing the queries where possible, 
but where this is not possible, try to ensure temporary tables are always stored in memory.[br]
Watching the processlist for queries with temporary tables that take too long to resolve can give you an early warning that 
tmp table size needs to be upped.[br]
Be aware that memory is also allocated per-thread.[br]
An example where upping this worked for more was a server where upped this from 32MB (the default) to 64MB with immediate effect.[br]
The quicker resolution of queries resulted in less threads being active at any one time, with all-round benefits for the server, and available memory.
